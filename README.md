# 3d-printing
My 3D printing stuff

This repo contains all stuff related to my 3d printed objects.
In more detail this is:
- the slic3r config
- the 3d CAD files for PTC Creo Elements in case of self designed objects
- the gcode for printing them on my printer

Feel free to use them for your own needs but always keep in mind that every 3d printer 
is different, so it might happen that my gcode does not print well on your printer...
